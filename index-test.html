Всем привет! Меня зовут Виктор Борисов — я фотожурналист и путешественник. У меня огромное количество интересов, но основные это автомобильная журналистика, строительство и общественные проекты. За несколько лет в моём блоге скопилось огромное количество ценной информации, для просмотра которой потребуется несколько дней. В этой записи я собрал ссылки на самые интересные статьи. А в дальнейшем рекомендую ориентироваться по журналу с помощью тегов. Кроме этого можно посмотреть старый рубрикатор, который я вёл до конца 2010 года (часть 1, часть 2).

					<p>Thus much I thought proper to tell you in relation to yourself, and to the trust I reposed in you.	However, many of the most learned and wise adhere to the new scheme of expressing themselves by things; which has only this inconvenience attending it, that if a man’s business be very great, and of various kinds, he must be obliged, in proportion, to carry a greater bundle of things upon his back, unless he can afford one or two strong servants to attend him. I have often beheld two of those sages almost sinking under the weight of their packs, like pedlars among us, who, when they met in the street, would lay down their loads, open their sacks, and hold conversation for an hour together.</p>
